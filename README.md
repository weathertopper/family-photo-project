## Family Photo Project

In an effort to save the photos currently stored underneath my grandma's bed, I'm making a Rails application that uploads family photos alongside a family tree.

When I have the time ( or get up the gumption to care), I'll write out my current schematic in this README. I don't know how much code I will actually push to this repo; I mainly want to use it to track issues :)
