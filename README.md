## Family Photo Project

_UPDATE SEPT 10 2017_

This README was terribly out of date, so I wiped it clean.

Long and short, the site now lives. I occasionally backup the DBs with a script on the server machine, but other than that, it's as done as it's going to be. Instead of my family uploading pictures and audio recordings, most of them have opted to send me their pictures and recordings. I should have seen that coming. Oh well :)

An explanation of how to use the site is on its [home page](http://www.weatherly.tech/). It ain't perfect, but it's usable.

Nox.
